# MachineLearningLabs
A collection of Machine Learning and Data Mining labs for the ML course taught at INSAT.
## Supervised Learning : 
During those labs we implemented the :
* `Naive Bayes`
* `KNN`
* `Random Forests`
models on the Iris Dataset and used the test validation with different validation metrics using `train/test split` and `Cross Validation`
## Unsupervised Learning:
* `KMeans Clustering`
* `CAH` Agglomerative clustering and `Dendrograms`
* `Silhouette` and `Elbow` to determine the best number of clusters
* `Crosstab` to validate between models
* We manually implemented `DIANA` algorithm based on Kmeans
